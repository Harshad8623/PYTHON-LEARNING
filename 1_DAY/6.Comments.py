# Single line Comments



# Python has no official multi-line comment syntax
'''
This is a multi-line comment
which spans multiple lines.
It is often used to provide detailed explanations
or documentation for code sections.

"""Another way to write multi-line comments
is by using triple double quotes.
This is also useful for documentation.
